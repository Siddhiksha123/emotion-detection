Emotion Detection Project
Overview
This project aims to detect and classify human emotions from text, audio, or image inputs. It utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze input data and predict the corresponding emotions.

Features
Text Emotion Detection
Audio Emotion Detection
Image Emotion Detection
Requirements
List the necessary dependencies and libraries required to run the project. For example:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NLTK
etc.
Installation
Provide instructions on how to install the project and its dependencies. For example:

pip install -r requirements.txt
from emotion_detection import EmotionDetector

# Create an instance of the emotion detector
detector = EmotionDetector()

# Analyze text emotion
text = "I feel happy today"
text_emotion = detector.detect_text_emotion(text)
print("Text Emotion:", text_emotion)

# Analyze audio emotion
audio_file = "audio.wav"
audio_emotion = detector.detect_audio_emotion(audio_file)
print("Audio Emotion:", audio_emotion)

# Analyze image emotion
image_file = "image.jpg"
image_emotion = detector.detect_image_emotion(image_file)
print("Image Emotion:", image_emotion)
